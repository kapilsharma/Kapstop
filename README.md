Personal Cloud
==============
Lot of cloud applications are available now a days. However lot of peoples are not comfortable to put their sensitive data on third party cloud.

KAPsTop objective is to design a set of tools/applications which allow users to create their own cloud that can be used for personal use as well as
allowing few other friend/family member to use that cloud. For this, we have set following goals for ourself:

1. System must be light weight, so that it can even be hosted on shared hosting.
2. Since we need to support shared hosting, we need to ensure not to expect any php.ini change and must work with php.ini settings that are common
on most shared hosting.
3. List to be grown further.
