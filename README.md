Personal Cloud
==============
Lot of cloud applications are available now a days. However lot of peoples are not comfortable to put their sensitive data on third party cloud.

My purpose is to design a set of tools/applications which allow users to create their own cloud that can be used for personal use as well as
allowing few other friend/family member to use that cloud. Designing a server side solution is not a big deal for such personal clouds however
having plugins (small apps) for personal cloud is important. I'm also working on those apps and server side platform, which will be light enough
to work even with shared hosting. Again a front end with some desktop type feel is also needed. This project (KapsTop)
deal with frontend part. It will have security features against third party plugins. However since it is intended for personal cloud, security
feature is limited. Any web-desktop (including) is not secure for other projects.

KapsTop
=======
KapsTop is intended to have a desktop type environment on the web, with support for third party applications.

Technologies
------------
Since the project is intended to run on browsers, only available technologies are HTML, CSS & Java Script. However to allow
short & effective code, we heavyly use JQuery as it is not become defacto standard in Java Script Libraries.

With latest technologies, we are also planning to use few HTML5 features. This will make code unusable on legacy browsers
(Well for us, any browser that do not support HTML5 by default is legacy browser) but since expectation with this project
is kept very high, it is necessary to utilize maximum power of latest and best technology. Again it is intended for personal
cloud so supporting legacy browser is not actually needed.
